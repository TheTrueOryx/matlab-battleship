To run Battleship, set your MATLAB directory to this folder 
and execute the 'runMe' program.

The game will take turns between the user and the computer,
with each selecting locations to fire at.  If a shot hits a
ship, that ship is damaged.  Once all sections of a ship
have been damaged, that ship is sunk.  Once all of one
player's ships have been sunk the game is over.  The player
with any remaining ships wins!
